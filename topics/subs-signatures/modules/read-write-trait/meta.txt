whenever you call a subroutine (or a method) with a variable as an argument, 
it will bind to the value in the container.
And because you cannot assign to a value, you get:

"Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value"

---

If you want to allow assigning to the outer value, 
you can add the is rw trait to the variable in the signature. 
This will bind the variable in the signature to the container 
of the variable specified, thus allowing assignment
