The :D combined with the Int indicates that you want a Defined value of the Int type. 
Because :D is also the emoji for a big smile, this decoration on the type is called a "type smiley." 
So what happens if you pass an undefined value to such a subroutine?

Careful readers may realize that this should create a compile-time error. But alas, it 
hasn't (yet). Although error messages are known to be pretty awesome in Perl 6, there 
is still a lot of work to make them even better (and more timely, in this case).
